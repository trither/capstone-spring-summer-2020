# What you need to run the app:

1. For IDE im using VS code, I'm pretty sure setup shouldnt change much if you are using another.

2. Visit https://expo.io/learn
    Download node.js (reccomended version 12.16.3 LTS)
    Open terminal and type the command 
    npm install expo-cli --global
        You can use a windows / mac terminal, or alternatively, you could also just paste the command into a new terminal in VS code.

3. I'm not sure if node already does this but you may need to type 
    npm install 
      in your terminal to do the following commands

4. The only extra dependacy I have so far is react-native-maps copy the following command into the terminal.
    npm install --save react-native-maps
    
5. To run the app cd into the directory that the app is in and type 
    npm start
